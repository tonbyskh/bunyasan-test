Run the project with shell script in root directory

```
start-dev.sh << example for running in container
start-local.sh << run with local service implement
start-mock-service.sh << run with mock api-service by call itself
```

And able to test api with swagger-ui: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
